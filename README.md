# ReactJS
Learning ReactJS from CWH 2 hr course and here is all the codes that i coded during watching video.

## npx will run only onetime it will not download any library and stay there
```bash
npx create-react-app todo-list
```

```bash

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd todo-list
  npm start
```

```bash
cd todo-list
```
